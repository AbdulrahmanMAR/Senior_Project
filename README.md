Temp readme, will be fully rewritten later on but for now it's more of a check list and reminders.

Main Funtionality Code Status:

-Main: full translation implemented

-Data Collection: Fully implemented v2

-Model SR1: fully done with sklearn's RandomForestClassifier



This project consists of three main parts:

1-Main Functionality: Tracking hands and translating sign language

2-Text: Formatting the tranlated text and saving it

3-Interfaces: Creating interfaces for both desktop and mobile

A last part is porting it to Android but it probably won't be a big deal or time consuming.
